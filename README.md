# python-challenge

This is for the module 3 challenge for the bootcamp.

The goal was to create code that opened, analyzed and printed the results to the .txt file and on the terminal. I used jupyter and a combination of what we learned in section 3 - python and section 4 - pandas.

Helped me print to a tx file and keep the same format as the print in the terminal. It was a slight variation of the open method we used in class.

I am very proficient at excel, so I have learned how to take common excel functions and find the python equivalent. The .diff function allowed me to create a variable that was total difference between each budget and the previous budget, and find the .min, .max and .mean of that variable.
